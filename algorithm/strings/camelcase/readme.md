# CamelCase

Alice wrote a sequence of words in [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) as a string of letters, *s*, having the following properties:

 * It is a concatenation of one or more words consisting of English letters.
 * All letters in the first word are *lowercase*.
 * For each of the subsequent words, the first letter is *uppercase* and rest of the letters are *lowercase*.

Given *s*, print the number of words in *s* on a new line.

# Input Format

A single line containing string *s*.

# Constraints

 * 1 <= |*s*| <= 10^5

# Output Format

Print the number of words in string *s*.

# Sample Input

# Sample Output


    5
    
# Explanation

String *s* contains five words:

 1) save
 2) Changes
 3) In
 4) The
 5) Editor

Thus, we print **5** on a new line.
